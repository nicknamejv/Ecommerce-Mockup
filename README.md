## Ecommerce Mockup Hackathon

This is a two-day sprint hackathon where we are given a single page mockup and the goal is to recreate it with pure CSS, HTMl, and JS if needed. Coming into this I wanted to learn and understand more of vanilla CSS without working with a CSS framework. This has given me a great insight on how to quickly build out HTML pages.
